cHax Library
============

The cHax library provides a set of cross-platform APIs to enhance the standard
C library. There are two primary aims of cHax: 1) provide a uniform API
between platforms for system-specific primitive such as threading and
synchronization, and 2) provide additional APIs for common features not found
in the standard C library, including native data structures and better support
for virtual streams.
